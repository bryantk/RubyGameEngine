Code created in early 2014 to run a text based game asynchronously on a command line. The engine redraws the terminal at a target of 60fps. This allows for timed triggers, animations, and more.
I built a small text adventure following the plot of Dante's Inferno. Enjoy and feel free to rip it apart to learn/improve.

Made for linux, if running in windows or mac, you must change the code to accept windows/mac styled end of line characters.
